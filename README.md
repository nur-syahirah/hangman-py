# 🎮 Hangman Game

A simple word-guessing game built using **Python** and **Tkinter**.

This project was created as my **first Python project** to practice and solidify the programming concepts I had recently learned. It helped me get hands-on experience with Python basics, GUI programming, and logical problem-solving.

## 📌 About the Project

The **Hangman Game** is a classic word-guessing game where the player must guess the hidden word one letter at a time. Each incorrect guess adds a part to the hangman drawing. The game ends when the player either guesses the word correctly or the hangman is fully drawn.

This project served as a hands-on exercise for practicing:

- Python syntax and logic
- Basic GUI development with Tkinter
- Functions and control flow
- Basic error handling

---

## ✨ Features

- Basic interactive graphical interface using Tkinter
- Random word selection from a predefined list
- Visual feedback with hangman drawings
- Input validation for letters
- Win/lose game states with restart option

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter** (Standard Python GUI library)
